This is a sample of the BioVid heat pain dataset. The datasets were obtained from laboratory experiments. There are 87 subjects in part A and 86 in part B. The 100 signal files were generated from each subject. The 8700 samples in part A and the 8600 in part B were analyzed. During the analysis, the detected R-peaks of all samples were drawn and generated in pdf format. I applied filters and Pan Tompkins algorithm to detect R reaks of ECG, and removed noises by the amplitude of the R waves.
